# Prerequisites

## 1. Docker Desktop (comes with Docker CLI)
### For **Windows** and **macOS**
Use **Docker Desktop**, which bundles the Docker Engine, CLI, and other tools.
- Download from Docker's official site: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
- Documentation for Windows: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/
- Documentation for macOS: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/ 


## 2. Terraform CLI
Install free open source manager to download terraform directly into your CLI

### **Windows**: Using Using Chocolatey 
1. **Install Chocolatey**. If you don't already have it, open a **PowerShell terminal as an administrator**. Run the following command:
```
# powershell
> Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))\
```
2. **Install Terraform**. After Chocolatey is installed, use the following command in your **PowerShell terminal** to install Terraform:
```
# powershell
> choco install terraform
```
3. **Verify the installation**. To confirm that Terraform is installed and working, in your terminal and run:
```
# powershell
> terraform -version
```

### **macOS**: Using Homebrew
1. **Install Homebrew**. If you don't have Homebrew installed, open a **Terminal** and run the following command:
```
# bash
> /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
2. **Add HashiCorp tap**. To ensure you get the official version, add the HashiCorp tap to your Homebrew installation:
```
# bash
> brew tap hashicorp/tap
```
3. **Install Terraform**. Now, install Terraform using Homebrew:
```
# bash
> brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform
```
4. **Verify the installation**. After the installation is complete, run this command in your terminal:
```
# bash
> terraform -version
```
